# MyDivinations Backend & Web

MyDivinations is an AI-driven divination platform that uses Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC) to help users discover archetypal patterns and increase consciousness through interactive experiences.

## Project Overview

This repository contains:
1. The backend microservices serving both the Unity application and web frontend
2. The Next.js web application providing a mobile-friendly experience
3. Coordination documents for our multi-agent development team

The system provides:
- Accurate astrological calculations through the Astrology Engine Service
- Archetypal pattern mapping from astrological data
- Fractal visualization parameters for both Unity and web implementations
- Personalized content generation based on user's archetypal profile
- Interactive symbolic journeys through the Path of Symbols experience

## Repository Structure

- `/coordination` - AI agent coordination documents
- `/docs` - Project documentation
- `/services` - Backend microservices
- `/shared` - Shared libraries and utilities
- `/frontend` - Next.js web application
- `/deploy` - Deployment configurations

## For AI Team Members

This project uses a coordinated AI agent approach. If you're an AI agent working on this project:

1. First read `/coordination/HowWeWork.md` to understand the collaboration protocol
2. Check your specific agent handoff document in `/coordination/handoffs/`
3. Review the recent changes in `/coordination/CHANGELOG.md`
4. Review the current project status in `/coordination/STATUS.md`
5. Update these documents at the end of your session

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for Node.js services and web application)
- Python 3.9+ (for Python services)
- Supabase CLI (for local database)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure environment variables
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the development environment
4. See service-specific READMEs for further instructions

### Web Application Setup
1. Navigate to `/frontend` directory
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure environment variables
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Development Process

- Each component follows a documented specification
- Services and applications are containerized for consistent development and deployment
- Integration happens through well-defined API contracts
- Changes are coordinated through our AI agent protocol
- Both web and Unity applications consume the same backend APIs
