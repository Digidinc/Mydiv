## Design System Overview

The MyDivinations design system is built around the following principles:

1. **Minimalist Interface** - Focused on content, reducing visual noise
2. **Symbolic Representation** - Using visual symbols to convey archetypal meaning
3. **Cosmic Palette** - Color scheme inspired by celestial elements
4. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance

## Current Design Documents

The detailed design system documentation is currently available in:
- `/GameDesign/Implementation/Design_System.md` - Comprehensive design guidelines
- `/GameDesign/UX/Web_User_Onboarding_Flow.md` - User onboarding flow

## Color Palette

- **Primary**: Deep Indigo (`#3730A3`) - Consciousness and insight
- **Secondary**: Teal (`#0D9488`) - Growth and transformation

## Component Design Approach

Components follow these design principles:
1. **Atomic Design Methodology** - Building from atoms to organisms
2. **Consistent Interaction Patterns** - Predictable user interactions
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works everywhere
4. **Visual Hierarchy** - Clear importance relationships between elements
5. **Motion with Purpose** - Animation that enhances understanding

## Migration Plan

As part of the documentation reorganization, the current design documents will be migrated to this directory with standardized formatting.
