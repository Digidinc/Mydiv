# MyDivinations Design Documentation

This directory contains design documentation for the MyDivinations project.

## Contents

- `design-system.md` - Design system specifications (planned)
- `user-flows.md` - User flows and journey documentation (planned)
- `ui-components.md` - UI component specifications (planned)

## Design Status

The design documentation in this directory is currently in planning stage only. Implementation of frontend components has been postponed until the backend services are more mature.

## Design Principles

The MyDivinations design system will be built around the following principles:

1. **Minimalist Interface** - Focus on content, reducing visual noise
2. **Symbolic Representation** - Use visual symbols to convey archetypal meaning
3. **Cosmic Palette** - Color scheme inspired by celestial elements
4. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance

## Current Status

Design documentation is in planning stage only. Design implementation will begin after key backend functionality is in place.

## Future Documentation

When frontend development begins, the following will be addressed:

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep Indigo - Consciousness and insight
- **Secondary**: Teal - Growth and transformation
- **Accent**: Dark Orange - For important elements
- **Neutrals**: Various shades from nearly white to deep charcoal

### Typography
- **Headings**: Raleway
- **Body**: Inter
- **Accent/Quotes**: Playfair Display

### Component Design Approach
- **Atomic Design Methodology** - Building from atoms to organisms
- **Consistent Interaction Patterns** - Predictable user interactions
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works everywhere
- **Visual Hierarchy** - Clear importance relationships between elements
- **Motion with Purpose** - Animation that enhances understanding
