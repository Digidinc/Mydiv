- ✅ Updated services README.md with implementation details
- ✅ Added setup instructions and next steps

## Next Development Tasks

### Astrology Engine Service
1. Implement Swiss Ephemeris integration
2. Create endpoints for basic chart calculations
3. Implement Redis caching for frequently requested calculations
4. Add unit and integration tests
5. Implement error handling and logging

### Web Application
1. Set up Next.js application structure
2. Create basic UI components
3. Implement API integration with astrology-engine
4. Set up authentication
