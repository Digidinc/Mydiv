# Project Status

## Overall Progress

The MyDivinations project is making steady progress with a focus on backend infrastructure. Here's the current status of major components:

### Backend Services (30% Complete)

#### Astrology Engine Service (40% Complete)
- âœ… Basic FastAPI application setup
- âœ… Health check endpoint
- âœ… Docker containerization
- âœ… Redis integration
- âœ… Basic project structure
- âœ… Initial documentation
- ðŸ”„ Swiss Ephemeris integration (In Progress)
- ðŸ“… Birth chart calculations (Planned)
- ðŸ“… Planetary positions (Planned)
- ðŸ“… Aspects calculations (Planned)
- ðŸ“… Transits and progressions (Planned)

#### Other Services (Planned)
- Archetypal Mapping Service
- Fractal Visualization Service
- Content Generation Service
- Audio Generation Service
- API Gateway

### Frontend Development (Postponed)

Frontend development has been postponed until the backend services are more mature. The initial plans and documentation have been prepared, but implementation will begin after key backend functionality is in place.

## Current Sprint Focus

### Backend
1. Implementing Swiss Ephemeris integration
2. Setting up birth chart calculation endpoints
3. Developing planetary position calculations
4. Planning aspects calculation system

## Next Sprint Planning

### Backend
1. Complete birth chart calculations
2. Implement aspects calculation
3. Begin transits and progressions system
4. Start archetypal mapping service

## Recent Achievements

### Backend
- Successfully set up the Astrology Engine service
- Implemented Docker containerization
- Integrated Redis for caching
- Established basic project structure

## Known Issues

### Backend
1. Swiss Ephemeris integration complexity
2. Performance optimization needed for calculations
3. API documentation needs updating

## Upcoming Milestones

### Q2 2025
1. Complete Swiss Ephemeris integration
2. Launch birth chart calculation system
3. Implement basic archetypal mapping
4. Begin frontend development

### Q3 2025
1. Launch transits and progressions system
2. Implement advanced archetypal features
3. Release content generation service
4. Complete web application MVP

## Resource Allocation

### Current Focus
- 3 Backend developers
