   - Critical for implementation to begin
   - Dependencies: None
   - Status: In progress, Astrology Engine complete

2. **API Gateway Design** (Owner: BEA)
   - Critical for service communication
   - Dependencies: Service communication patterns
   - Status: Early design phase

3. **Unity API Contracts** (Owner: BEA & GD)
   - Critical for frontend-backend integration
   - Dependencies: Service specifications
   - Status: Initial contract created for Astrology Engine

4. **Implementation of First Service** (Owner: Cursor)
   - Critical for validating architecture
   - Dependencies: Service specifications
   - Status: Awaiting complete specifications

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|------------|-------|
| Integration complexity | High | Medium | Detailed API contracts, early testing | BEA |
| Performance bottlenecks | High | Medium | Caching strategy, optimization focus | BEA/Cursor |
| Unity implementation challenges | Medium | Medium | Clear contracts, technical guidance | GD/Essi |
| AI coordination gaps | Medium | Low | Handoff protocol, overlap documentation | AI CEO |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Clear MVP definition, prioritization | AI CEO/Hadi |

## Next Steps

1. **For BEA**:
   - Complete Archetypal Mapping Service specification
   - Finalize API Gateway design
   - Define authentication framework
   - Create database schema for Archetypal Mapping

2. **For GD**:
   - Complete technical specifications for fractal visualization
   - Define exact API requirements for Unity implementation
   - Create asset requirements list
   - Develop test cases for symbolic resonance

3. **For AI CEO**:
   - Set up initial repository structure for services
   - Create GitHub workflow configurations
   - Develop project boards for tracking
   - Establish issue templates and PR templates

4. **For Cursor AI**:
   - Begin scaffolding code for Astrology Engine
   - Implement core calculation framework
   - Set up testing framework
   - Create initial Docker configurations

5. **For Essi**:
   - Prepare Unity repository structure (in separate repo)
   - Implement basic Unity structure for Path of Symbols
   - Create initial shader framework for fractal visualization
   - Plan integration with backend APIs

## Weekly Goals (March 15-22)
