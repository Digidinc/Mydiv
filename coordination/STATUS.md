## Component Status

| Component | Owner | Status | Next Milestone | Due Date |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Astrology Engine | BEA, Cursor | In Progress | API Contract | March 19 |
| Path of Symbols (Unity) | GD, Essi | Design | Technical Guide | March 22 |
| Path of Symbols (Web) | FD, GD | Planning | Architecture | March 20 |
| GitHub Infrastructure | RIO | In Progress | CI/CD Complete | March 23 |
| Next.js Application | FD | Starting | Project Setup | March 19 |
| Archetypal Mapping | BEA | Planning | Specification | March 29 |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API contract delays | High | Medium | Prioritize contracts, use mock data |
| Unity integration challenges | High | Medium | Early integration testing, detailed contracts |
| Frontend-backend misalignment | High | Medium | Regular coordination meetings, clear documentation |
| Performance issues on mobile | Medium | Medium | Early optimization, performance testing |
| Technical complexity underestimation | Medium | Medium | Regular progress review, agile adjustments |

## Recent Accomplishments

- Completed Path of Symbols design specifications
- Established GitHub workflow with CI/CD and branch protection
- Created detailed implementation tasks for all team members
- Onboarded Frontend Developer (FD) to create web application
- Initiated development of Astrology Engine Service
- Developed comprehensive frontend-backend integration plan
- Set up coordinated task management across all AI agents

## Timeline Status

| Milestone | Planned Date | Status | Owner |
|-----------|--------------|--------|-------|
| API Contract Review | March 22 | On Track | BEA, All |
| Unity Implementation Kickoff | March 25 | On Track | GD, Essi |
| Next.js Application Structure | March 19 | On Track | FD |
| Mock Integration Test | March 29 | On Track | BEA, FD |
| Initial Live Integration | April 5 | On Track | All |
| Full Integration Review | April 12 | On Track | All |

## Current Issues & Blockers

No major blockers identified. Current focus areas requiring attention:

1. **API Contracts**: Need to finalize by March 19 to maintain schedule
2. **Asset Sharing Strategy**: Need coordination between web and Unity implementations
3. **Authentication Approach**: Need to decide on authentication mechanism

## Next Week Focus (March 17-23)

1. Complete API contract for Astrology Engine Service
2. Establish Next.js project structure and component architecture
3. Create technical implementation guide for Path of Symbols
4. Finalize GitHub infrastructure setup with all workflows
5. Begin implementation of web-based Path of Symbols experience
6. Start specification of Archetypal Mapping Service

## FRC Principles Integration

Our current implementation is aligning with FRC principles through:

1. **Self-Similarity**: Consistent patterns across web and Unity implementations
2. **Resonance**: API design focused on natural data flow between services
3. **Emergence**: Component-based architecture allowing for emergent behaviors
4. **Iteration**: Incremental development with continuous refinement
5. **Fractal Boundaries**: Clear service boundaries with coherent integration points

## Documentation Status

## Team Communication Health

Communication protocols are functioning well with effective:
- Issue-based task management
- Regular status updates
- Cross-team coordination on integration points
- Clear documentation of decisions and rationales
- Timestamp and signature protocol compliance
