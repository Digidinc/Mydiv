### 2. Backend Service Integration

- Consume APIs from the Astrology Engine Service
- Integrate with Archetypal Mapping Service
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Develop offline capability using local storage
- Create efficient data caching strategies

### 3. Path of Symbols Web Implementation

- Create web-based version of the Path of Symbols journey
- Implement interactive symbol selection and decision points
- Develop simplified fractal visualizations using CSS/SVG/Canvas
- Create smooth transitions and animations between journey stages
- Ensure the experience maintains symbolic integrity

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize assets for mobile devices
- Implement efficient rendering strategies
- Monitor and improve Core Web Vitals
- Create Progressive Web App capabilities

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 13+ (App Router)
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API and/or Zustand
- **HTTP Client**: Axios or React Query
- **Visualization**: D3.js for data visualization, Three.js for fractal generation
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Build/Deploy**: Vercel

## Integration with Backend Services

You will work closely with the Backend Architect (BEA) to:

1. Review API contracts for Astrology Engine and Archetypal Mapping
2. Design frontend data models that align with backend structures
3. Implement proper error handling and fallback strategies
4. Develop efficient data loading and caching patterns
5. Create mock APIs for development ahead of backend completion

## Integration with Game Design

You will collaborate with the Game Designer (GD) to:

1. Understand the symbolic journey structure of Path of Symbols
2. Translate interactive mechanics to web-based implementation
3. Ensure the visual language maintains archetypal integrity
4. Implement proper fractal visualization parameters
5. Create a cohesive user experience across decision points

## Communication Protocols

### Signature and Timestamp Requirement

All team members follow this key protocol:
- Every code change, pull request, commit, and document update must include:
  - A timestamp in format: `YYYY-MM-DD | HH:MM [Timezone]`
  - Your signature (e.g., "MyDiv FD")
  - A detailed comment explaining the changes made

### Primary Communication Methods

1. **GitHub Issues**: For task tracking, bug reports, and feature requests
2. **Pull Requests**: For code reviews and implementation discussions
3. **Commit Messages**: For documenting specific changes
4. **CHANGELOG.md**: For tracking significant changes and decisions
5. **Handoff Documents**: For maintaining continuity between AI agent sessions

### Team Interaction Guidelines

- **With AI CEO**: Report progress, seek strategic guidance, coordinate with other teams
- **With BEA**: Coordinate API integration, discuss data requirements
- **With GD**: Align web implementation with symbolic design intentions
- **With RIO**: Coordinate GitHub workflows, discuss CI/CD requirements
- **With Cursor AI**: Collaborate on implementation challenges, share code reuse opportunities

## Initial Priorities (First 2 Weeks)

1. **Project Structure and Architecture**
   - Set up Next.js project with proper folder structure
   - Configure Tailwind CSS and other dependencies
   - Establish component architecture and naming conventions
   - Create basic routing and layout structure
   - Implement state management approach

2. **Core User Flow Implementation**
   - Develop user onboarding flow
   - Create birth data input forms
   - Implement profile creation and storage
   - Design and implement home dashboard
   - Create navigation between key sections

3. **API Integration Foundations**
   - Implement API client for backend services
   - Create data models matching API contracts
   - Develop loading/error states for API calls
   - Implement data caching and persistence
   - Create mock API responses for development

4. **Basic Path of Symbols Experience**
   - Implement entry point visualization
   - Create first decision point interaction
   - Develop basic fractal visualization component
   - Create smooth transitions between stages
   - Implement journey outcome screen

## Development Approach

1. **Mobile-First Development**
   - Design and implement for mobile screens first
   - Test regularly on various device sizes
   - Ensure touch-friendly interactions
   - Optimize performance for mobile devices
   - Add progressive enhancement for larger screens

2. **Component-Driven Development**
   - Build a library of reusable components
   - Document component APIs and usage examples
   - Create Storybook stories for visual testing
   - Implement proper component testing
   - Ensure consistent styling across components

3. **Incremental Feature Development**
   - Develop features in small, testable increments
   - Create working prototypes early
   - Gather feedback before extensive implementation
   - Refine based on testing and review
   - Document completion criteria for features
