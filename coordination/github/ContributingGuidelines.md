# Contributing Guidelines Documentation

This document explains the contribution guidelines implemented for the MyDivinations project.

## Overview

The CONTRIBUTING.md file serves as the central resource for contributors, providing guidance on how to effectively participate in the development of MyDivinations. It outlines coding standards, workflow processes, and expectations for all contributions.

## Key Components

### Code of Conduct

The contributing guidelines begin with a Code of Conduct that emphasizes:
- Creating a welcoming and inclusive environment
- Maintaining professional standards of communication
- Treating all participants with respect

### Getting Started

The getting started section provides a step-by-step process for new contributors:
1. Forking the repository
2. Cloning the fork
3. Adding the upstream repository
4. Creating branches
5. Making changes
6. Submitting pull requests

This workflow is designed to be accessible to both new and experienced contributors.

### Development Workflow

The development workflow section explains:
- The microservices architecture
- The role of each service
- The layered architecture within services
- The importance of separation of concerns

This helps contributors understand the overall project structure and where their contributions fit.

### Branching Strategy

The branching strategy section documents the GitHub Flow approach with customizations:
- `main` branch as the production-ready branch
- Feature branches with naming convention: `feature/descriptive-name`
- Hotfix branches with naming convention: `hotfix/issue-description`
- Including issue numbers in branch names when applicable

### Commit Message Guidelines

The commit message guidelines establish a standardized format:
```
[Role] Type: Brief description (max 72 chars)

Detailed explanation if needed (optional)

YYYY-MM-DD | HH:MM Timezone
Your Name/Role
```

This format ensures:
- Clear attribution to specific roles
- Categorization of changes (Spec, Doc, Feat, Fix, Refactor, Chore)
- Timestamps for tracking and accountability
- Detailed context when needed

### Pull Request Process

The PR process outlines the steps for contributing code:
1. Creating an issue before starting work
2. Using the PR template
3. Linking related issues
4. Passing CI checks
5. Requesting reviews
6. Addressing feedback
7. Including timestamp and signature

This process maintains quality and ensures proper review of all changes.

### Coding Standards

The coding standards section provides language-specific guidelines:

**Python**:
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use black for formatting
- Use isort for import sorting
- Use flake8 for linting
- Include docstrings and type hints

**JavaScript/TypeScript** (for future services):
- Follow ESLint with Airbnb config
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Include JSDoc comments

These standards ensure consistency across the codebase.

### Testing

The testing section emphasizes the importance of testing:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical flows
- Minimum 70% coverage for core business logic

### Documentation

The documentation section highlights the importance of documentation:
- Code documentation (comments and docstrings)
- API documentation
- README updates
- Architecture documentation

### Timestamp and Signature Protocol

The timestamp and signature protocol reinforces the project's coordination framework:
- Required on all contributions
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD | HH:MM [Timezone]`
- Followed by role signature

## Maintenance

The CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines should be reviewed and updated periodically:
- When development processes change
- When new technologies are introduced
- To address common questions or issues
- To improve clarity or completeness

## Enforcement

These guidelines are enforced through:
- PR review process
- CI/CD pipelines
- Branch protection rules
- Team collaboration and feedback

## Integration with Other Documentation

The contributing guidelines work in conjunction with:
- Issue and PR templates
- Branch protection rules
- CI/CD workflow documentation
- HowWeWork.md coordination protocol

Together, these documents create a comprehensive framework for effective collaboration.
