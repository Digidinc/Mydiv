# Security Configuration

This document explains the security configuration implemented for the MyDivinations project.

## Overview

Security is a critical aspect of the MyDivinations project, especially given the nature of the data being processed and the user interactions involved. The security configuration implemented includes automated dependency management, code scanning, and vulnerability detection.

## Dependabot Configuration

Dependabot has been configured to automatically monitor and update dependencies across several ecosystems:

### Python Packages

```yaml
- package-ecosystem: "pip"
  directory: "/services/astrology-engine/"
  schedule:
    interval: "weekly"
    day: "monday"
```

- **Scope**: Python dependencies for the Astrology Engine Service
- **Frequency**: Weekly checks on Mondays
- **Pull Request Limit**: 5 open PRs at any time
- **Labels**: `dependencies`, `astrology-engine`, `security`
- **Reviewers**: Repository administrators

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
  directory: "/"
  schedule:
    interval: "weekly"
    day: "monday"
```

- **Scope**: All GitHub Actions workflows
- **Frequency**: Weekly checks on Mondays
- **Pull Request Limit**: 3 open PRs at any time
- **Labels**: `dependencies`, `infrastructure`
- **Reviewers**: Repository administrators

### Docker Images

```yaml
- package-ecosystem: "docker"
  directory: "/services/astrology-engine/"
  schedule:
    interval: "weekly"
    day: "monday"
```

- **Scope**: Docker images for the Astrology Engine Service
- **Frequency**: Weekly checks on Mondays
- **Pull Request Limit**: 3 open PRs at any time
- **Labels**: `dependencies`, `astrology-engine`, `infrastructure`
- **Reviewers**: Repository administrators

## Security Scanning Workflow

The project implements a comprehensive security scanning workflow that runs on:
- Every push to the `main` branch
- Every pull request targeting the `main` branch
- Scheduled runs at 6 AM every Monday

### CodeQL Analysis

```yaml
- name: CodeQL Analysis
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix:
      language: [ 'python' ]
```

- **Language Support**: Currently configured for Python
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
  - Detection of common coding errors
  - Identification of potentially insecure patterns

### Dependency Review

```yaml
- name: Dependency Review
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
```

- **Trigger**: Only on pull requests
- **Capabilities**:
  - Analyzes changes to dependencies
  - Blocks PRs with dependencies containing known vulnerabilities
  - Sets a severity threshold of "high"

### Python Security Scan

```yaml
- name: Python Security Scan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

- **Tools**:
  - Bandit: Scans Python code for security issues
  - Safety: Checks installed dependencies against a database of known vulnerabilities
- **Artifacts**: Results are uploaded as JSON files for review

### Docker Security Scan

```yaml
- name: Docker Security Scan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

- **Tool**: Trivy for container scanning
- **Configuration**:
  - Focuses on CRITICAL and HIGH severity vulnerabilities
  - Generates SARIF format for GitHub Security integration
  - Results uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning dashboards

## Integration with GitHub Security Features

The security configuration integrates with GitHub's security features:

1. **Security Alerts**: Enabled through Dependabot and CodeQL
2. **Code Scanning**: Results available in the Security tab
3. **Secret Scanning**: Automatically detects exposed secrets in the repository

## Best Practices

When working with the security configuration:

1. **Review Dependabot PRs promptly**: These ensure dependencies stay up-to-date and secure
2. **Address security alerts**: Treat HIGH and CRITICAL findings as high priority
3. **Regular review**: Periodically review scan results even if they don't trigger alerts
4. **Security testing**: Include security considerations in all tests
5. **Expand coverage**: As new services are added, update security scanning configuration

## Maintenance

The security configuration should be reviewed and updated:

- When adding new services or ecosystems
- When changing major technologies or frameworks
- Quarterly for general review of effectiveness
- When new security scanning tools become available

## Future Enhancements

Planned security enhancements include:

1. Implementing SAST (Static Application Security Testing) for JavaScript services
2. Adding secret scanning for infrastructure configuration
3. Implementing DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) in staging environments
4. Setting up security responsibility matrix for the team
