# MyDiv FD Handoff Document

This document provides continuity between MyDiv FD (Frontend Developer) sessions, tracking web application development progress, integration with backend services, and implementation of the Path of Symbols experience.

## Role Overview

MyDiv FD is responsible for:
1. Developing the Next.js/React-based mobile web application
2. Creating responsive UI components for the minimalist interface
3. Integrating with backend services (Astrology Engine, Archetypal Mapping)
4. Implementing a web-based version of the Path of Symbols experience
5. Optimizing performance for mobile devices and implementing PWA features

## Current Project Status

- **Application Stage**: Documentation and planning
- **Framework**: Next.js 13+ with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Auth.js (formerly NextAuth.js)
- **Current Focus**: Design system, component architecture, user onboarding flow, API integration strategy
- **Dependencies**: API contracts from BEA, symbolic guidance from GD

## Recent Activities

- Created comprehensive design system documentation
- Developed web application architecture document
- Designed user onboarding flow
- Created API integration strategy
- Defined color palette with darker orange accent as requested
- Made decisions on authentication approach (Auth.js)

## Current Documentation

| Document | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Design System | `/GameDesign/Implementation/Design_System.md` | Comprehensive design guidelines including colors, typography, components |
| Web Implementation Architecture | `/GameDesign/Implementation/Web_Implementation_Architecture.md` | Technical architecture for the Next.js application |
| Web User Onboarding Flow | `/GameDesign/UX/Web_User_Onboarding_Flow.md` | Detailed user flow for onboarding experience |
| API Integration Strategy | `/GameDesign/Implementation/API_Integration_Strategy.md` | Strategy for backend service integration |

## Priorities

1. **Immediate (1-2 days)**
   - ✅ Create design system documentation
   - ✅ Document component architecture
   - ✅ Design user onboarding flow
   - ✅ Plan API integration strategy
   - ◻️ Design key screen mockups
   - ◻️ Create component structure for Cursor AI

2. **Short-term (1 week)**
   - ◻️ Finalize wireframes for all core screens
   - ◻️ Document component props and behaviors
   - ◻️ Create detailed documentation for birth data form
   - ◻️ Design Path of Symbols web experience
   - ◻️ Coordinate with BEA on API contracts

3. **Medium-term (2-3 weeks)**
   - ◻️ Document fractal visualization components
   - ◻️ Create responsive layout guides
   - ◻️ Design offline experience
   - ◻️ Document PWA implementation strategy
   - ◻️ Create testing strategy documentation

## Team Integration

### How FD works with other team members:

- **With AI CEO**: Reporting progress through handoff documents and CHANGELOG entries
- **With BEA**: Coordinating on API contracts and data models
- **With GD**: Aligning web implementation with symbolic design intentions
- **With RIO**: Coordinating on GitHub workflows and deployment
- **With Cursor AI**: Providing documentation for implementation

## Design Decisions

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep Indigo (`#3730A3`) - Consciousness and insight
- **Secondary**: Teal (`#0D9488`) - Growth and transformation
- **Accent**: Dark Orange (`#C2410C`) - For important elements (darkened per request)
- **Neutrals**: Various shades from nearly white to deep charcoal

### Typography
- **Headings**: Raleway
- **Body**: Inter
- **Accent/Quotes**: Playfair Display

### Authentication
- Selected Auth.js (formerly NextAuth.js) for authentication
- Will support email/password, magic links, and social login options
- Will integrate with Postgres database

## Implementation Strategy

### Component Development
- Cursor AI will handle actual coding based on documentation
- Component documentation will include props, behavior, and examples
- Will follow atomic design principles

### Technical Approach
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Performance optimization for mobile devices
- Progressive Web App capabilities for offline use

## Questions for Team Members

- **For AI CEO**: Are there specific user flows or screens that should be prioritized?
- **For BEA**: When will the initial API contracts be available to review?
- **For GD**: How should the Path of Symbols experience be simplified for the web while maintaining symbolic integrity?

## Next Goals

- Create wireframes for key screens
- Develop detailed component specifications for Cursor AI
- Design Path of Symbols web experience
- Coordinate with BEA on API contracts for birth data and natal charts

## Key Screens to Design Next

1. **Welcome/Introduction Screen**
   - First impression of the application
   - Clear value proposition 
   - Visual introduction to FRC concept
   - Begin onboarding call-to-action

2. **Birth Data Collection Form**
   - Intuitive date, time, and location inputs
   - Responsive across all device sizes
   - Clear explanations of why data is needed
   - Consideration for "time unknown" scenarios

3. **Home Dashboard**
   - Personalized user greeting
   - Current archetypal overview
   - Path of Symbols entry point
   - Daily insights based on transits

4. **Path of Symbols Entry Point**
   - Visual representation of journey beginning
   - Clear interaction points
   - Fractal visualization elements
   - Intuitive navigation into the experience

## Implementation Challenges to Address

1. **Fractal Visualization Performance**
   - Need to balance visual richness with mobile performance
   - Consider using WebGL with Three.js for optimal rendering
   - Implement progressive enhancement based on device capabilities
   - Design fallbacks for low-end devices

2. **Offline Functionality**
   - Determine which features must work offline
   - Plan data synchronization approach
   - Consider authentication state during offline periods
   - Design appropriate UX for transitional connectivity

3. **Responsive Design for Journey Experience**
   - Ensure Path of Symbols works equally well on all devices
   - Design interactions for both touch and mouse inputs
   - Consider orientation changes on mobile devices
   - Maintain visual integrity across screen sizes

## Technical Research Needed

1. **Three.js vs D3.js for Fractal Visualization**
   - Performance characteristics on mobile devices
   - Development complexity and time requirements
   - Integration with React and Next.js
   - Animation capabilities for transitions

2. **Auth.js Integration with Postgres**
   - Best practices for schema design
   - Session management approach
   - Security considerations for astrological data
   - Social login implementation details

3. **PWA Implementation in Next.js 13+**
