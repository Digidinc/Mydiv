## Recent Implementation Activities

- Created initial project structure for Astrology Engine Service
- Implemented ephemeris provider interface for Swiss Ephemeris
- Started implementing core calculation engine
- Configured initial Docker setup for development
- Created Pydantic models for data validation

## Code Generation Focus

Current focus areas for code generation:

1. **Astrology Engine Core Functionality**:
   - Complete Swiss Ephemeris provider implementation
   - Implement planet position calculation
   - Implement house system calculations
   - Create aspect calculation module

2. **API Implementation**:
   - FastAPI endpoint setup
   - Request validation
   - Response formatting
   - Error handling middleware

3. **Caching Implementation**:
   - Redis integration
   - Cache key generation
   - TTL management
   - Cache invalidation

## Technical Strategy

- Using FastAPI for Astrology Engine endpoints
- Implementing a layered architecture with separation of concerns
- Following the repository pattern for data access
- Using dependency injection for service composition
- Implementing comprehensive error handling

## Development Environment

- Docker-based development environment
- Local Redis instance for caching
- Ephemeris data mounted as volume
- Hot reloading for development efficiency

## Implementation Notes

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use type hints consistently throughout the codebase
- Create comprehensive docstrings for all public functions
- Implement unit tests for all calculation functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints

## Questions for Other Agents

- **@BEA**: Are there specific performance targets for the calculation engine?
- **@AI_CEO**: What is the preferred logging strategy for the services?
- **@GD**: What specific calculation precision is needed for fractal parameters?

## Next Implementation Milestones

- Complete Swiss Ephemeris provider implementation
- Implement birth chart calculation functionality
- Add planetary position endpoint implementation
- Create initial caching mechanism
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for testing

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Astrology Engine → Archetypal Mapping**: Provide birth chart data
- **API Gateway → All Services**: Authentication and routing
- **Unity Frontend → API Gateway**: Client requests for astrological data

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize calculation-heavy operations
- Implement efficient caching strategy
- Use asynchronous processing where appropriate
- Monitor memory usage for large calculations
