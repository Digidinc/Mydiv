# AI CEO Handoff Document

This document provides continuity between AI CEO sessions, tracking strategic direction, current priorities, and coordination needs.

## Current Project Status

- **Phase**: Initial repository and architecture setup
- **Timeline**: Week 2 of 12-week MVP development plan
- **Critical Path**: Backend architecture specification → Services implementation → Unity integration

## Recent Strategic Decisions

- Decided to separate backend and Unity frontend into distinct repositories
- Established microservices architecture with FastAPI and Node.js services
- Created AI agent coordination protocol to manage fragmented team structure
- Set up initial repository structure and documentation standards

## Team Status

### Backend Architect (BEA)
- Has created comprehensive specifications for Astrology Engine Service
- Needs to begin work on Archetypal Mapping Service specification
- Well-defined service communication patterns document created
- Excellence in technical documentation demonstrated

### Game Designer (GD)
- Has created detailed design for Path of Symbols experience
- Fractal visualization system comprehensively specified
- Needs to coordinate with BEA on API requirements for Unity integration
- Excellent progress on symbolic journey mechanics

### Unity Developer (Essi)
- Will work in separate repository
- Needs clear API contracts from backend team
- Primary focus on implementing Path of Symbols experience
- Integration points with backend services being defined

### Cursor AI
- Will assist with implementation of backend services
- Needs structured specifications to generate code effectively
- Will support both BEA and GD in implementation

## Current Priorities

1. **Complete Repository Setup**
   - Finalize directory structure
   - Add service templates
   - Create GitHub workflows
   - Set up project boards

2. **Initialize Core Services**
   - Start with Astrology Engine as first service
   - Set up API Gateway for unified access
   - Create shared libraries for common functionality

3. **Establish Integration Framework**
   - Define API contract standards
   - Create contract testing approach
   - Document integration points with Unity

## Coordination Needs

- **BEA → GD**: Technical requirements for implementing fractal visualizations
- **GD → BEA**: API needs for Path of Symbols experience
- **AI CEO → All**: Overall architecture and integration strategy
- **All → Cursor AI**: Implementation specifications for code generation

## Open Questions/Issues

- How will authentication flow work between Unity client and backend services?
- What is the optimal deployment strategy for the microservices?
- How should we handle user data migration during development?
- Which service should be prioritized after Astrology Engine?

## Next Expected Milestones

- Complete backend repository structure and initial documentation by March 20
- First service (Astrology Engine) implemented by April 1
- API Gateway and shared authentication by April 7
- Initial integration with Unity frontend by April 15
