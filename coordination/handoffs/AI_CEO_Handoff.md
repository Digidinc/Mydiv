# AI CEO Handoff Document

This document provides continuity between AI CEO sessions, tracking strategic direction, current priorities, and coordination needs.

## Current Project Status

- **Phase**: Repository structure setup and initial code implementation
- **Timeline**: Week 2 of 12-week MVP development plan
- **Critical Path**: Backend architecture specification → Services implementation → Unity integration

## Recent Strategic Decisions

- Separated backend and Unity frontend into distinct repositories
- Established microservices architecture with FastAPI and Node.js services
- Created AI agent coordination protocol to manage fragmented team structure
- Set up initial repository structure and documentation standards
- Implemented basic code structure for Astrology Engine Service

## Team Status

### Backend Architect (BEA)
- Has created comprehensive specifications for Astrology Engine Service
- Needs to begin work on Archetypal Mapping Service specification
- Well-defined service communication patterns document created
- Excellence in technical documentation demonstrated

### Game Designer (GD)
- Has created detailed design for Path of Symbols experience
- Fractal visualization system comprehensively specified
- Needs to coordinate with BEA on API requirements for Unity integration
- Excellent progress on symbolic journey mechanics

### Unity Developer (Essi)
- Will work in separate repository
- Needs clear API contracts from backend team
- Primary focus on implementing Path of Symbols experience
- Integration points with backend services being defined

### Cursor AI
- Will assist with implementation of backend services
- Core service structure now ready for detailed implementation
- Will need to focus on fleshing out the placeholder implementations with real code
- Next focus should be on completing the Astrology Engine Service implementation

## Current Priorities

1. **Complete Backend Implementation**
   - Complete the Astrology Engine Service implementation
     - Implement endpoints for other planetary calculations
     - Add testing suite
     - Implement caching layer
   - Begin Archetypal Mapping Service specification and implementation
   - Implement API Gateway

2. **Technical Integration**
   - Define detailed API contracts for Unity integration
   - Create authentication and authorization system
   - Define WebSocket implementation for real-time updates

3. **Documentation and Coordination**
   - Maintain coordination documents as team progresses
   - Create detailed implementation guides for Cursor AI
   - Document API endpoints comprehensively

## Coordination Needs

- **BEA → GD**: Technical requirements for implementing fractal visualizations
- **GD → BEA**: API needs for Path of Symbols experience
- **AI CEO → All**: Overall architecture and integration strategy
- **All → Cursor AI**: Implementation specifications for code generation

## Open Questions/Issues

- How will authentication flow work between Unity client and backend services?
- What is the optimal deployment strategy for the microservices?
- How should we handle user data migration during development?
- Which service should be prioritized after Astrology Engine?

## Implementation Progress

We have successfully implemented:

1. **AI Agent Coordination Framework**
   - Handoff documents for continuity between AI agent sessions
   - Change tracking via CHANGELOG.md
   - Status tracking via STATUS.md
   - Clear guidelines in HowWeWork.md

2. **Repository Structure**
   - Clear organization for services, shared libraries, and documentation
   - Standard file structure for microservices
   - Docker-based development environment

3. **Astrology Engine Service Basics**
   - Core service structure implemented
   - API endpoints defined
   - Data models created
   - Core calculation engine structure implemented

## Next Expected Milestones

- Complete Astrology Engine Service implementation by March 25
- Begin Archetypal Mapping Service implementation by March 28
- Implement API Gateway by April 5
- Initial integration with Unity frontend by April 15
