# Game Designer (GD) Handoff Document

This document provides continuity between Game Designer sessions, tracking design decisions, user experience flow, and integration requirements for the Unity implementation.

## Current Design Focus

- **Primary Experience**: Path of Symbols interactive journey
- **Next Priority**: Fractal visualization technical specifications for Unity
- **Integration**: API requirements for backend services
- **Documentation**: User experience flow and interaction patterns

## Recent Design Decisions

- Created a branching decision tree with 8 distinct endings for the Path of Symbols
- Designed interaction mechanics focused on meaningful symbolic choices
- Developed a comprehensive fractal visualization system responsive to user choices
- Created the archetypal mapping system between astrological data and symbolic elements
- Established color introduction strategy for the fractal visualization

## User Experience Evolution

- Initial MVP will focus on the Path of Symbols experience
- Future phases will add additional symbolic journeys
- Planning for audio integration to enhance the experience
- Designing for eventual EEG integration in future phases

## Technical Requirements for Unity

- Shader implementation for fractal visualization
- Touch interaction system for symbolic choices
- Animation system for fractal evolution
- Audio-visual synchronization framework
- Personalization based on astrological data

## Backend Integration Requirements

The following API endpoints are needed from backend services:

1. **From Astrology Engine Service**:
   - User's birth chart data
   - Dominant elements and modalities
   - Current transit information

2. **From Archetypal Mapping Service**:
   - User's archetypal profile
   - Archetypal journey recommendations
   - Shadow aspect identification

3. **From Fractal Visualization Service**:
   - Fractal parameters based on archetypal profile
   - Evolution parameters for journey progression
   - Resonance optimization parameters

4. **From Content Generation Service**:
   - Personalized reflective prompts
   - Journey narratives and context
   - Symbol interpretations

## Implementation Notes

- All visual elements should follow minimalist black and white aesthetic
- Color should be introduced gradually as specified in the Fractal Response System
- Performance optimization is critical for mobile devices
- Interactions should feel meaningful rather than gamified

## Questions for Other Agents

- **@BEA**: How can we ensure real-time updates of astrological transits during the user experience?
- **@AI_CEO**: What is the target device specification for the Unity implementation?
- **@Cursor**: Are there specific shader optimization techniques we should consider for mobile performance?

## Visual Design Elements

Key visual elements that need implementation:

1. **Fractal Base Patterns**:
   - Modified Mandelbrot set as primary foundation
   - Julia set variations for specific archetypal journeys
   - Recursive tree structures for growth-oriented journeys
   - Sierpinski variations for pattern-focused journeys

2. **Symbolic Elements**:
   - Archetypal symbols integrated into visualization
   - Transition animations between decision points
   - Visual feedback for user interactions
   - Subtle guidance cues based on archetypal profile

3. **User Interface Components**:
   - Decision point presentation
   - Reflection moment interface
   - Journey completion visualization
   - Journal integration

## Next Design Milestones

- Complete technical specifications for fractal shader implementation
- Finalize API requirements document for backend services
- Create detailed animation specifications for transitions
- Develop comprehensive testing protocol for user experience

## Testing Requirements

- Symbolic resonance validation with target user groups
- Performance testing on target mobile devices
- Emotional response measurement for different journeys
- Comprehension testing for symbolic meanings
