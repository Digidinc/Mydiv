# Backend Architect (BEA) Handoff Document

This document provides continuity between Backend Architect sessions, tracking technical specifications, implementation status, and architectural decisions.

## Current Focus

- **Primary Service**: Astrology Engine Service
- **Next Priority**: Archetypal Mapping Service
- **Integration**: Service Communication Patterns for microservice interactions
- **Documentation**: API Contracts for Unity integration

## Service Implementation Status

| Service | Specification | Implementation | Integration | Status |
|---------|---------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| Astrology Engine | ‚úÖ Complete | üîÑ Pending | üîÑ Pending | Specification phase |
| Archetypal Mapping | üîÑ In Progress | ‚ùå Not Started | ‚ùå Not Started | Early specification |
| API Gateway | üîÑ In Progress | ‚ùå Not Started | ‚ùå Not Started | Early specification |
| Fractal Visualization | ‚ùå Not Started | ‚ùå Not Started | ‚ùå Not Started | Awaiting GD input |
| Content Generation | ‚ùå Not Started | ‚ùå Not Started | ‚ùå Not Started | Not started |
| Audio Generation | ‚ùå Not Started | ‚ùå Not Started | ‚ùå Not Started | Not started |

## Recent Technical Decisions

- Selected FastAPI for Astrology Engine Service due to performance requirements
- Designed a layered architecture for Astrology Engine with abstraction over Swiss Ephemeris
- Created a multi-level caching strategy for optimizing calculation performance
- Established service communication patterns with standardized error handling
- Defined detailed data models for astrological calculations

## Architecture Evolution

- Initial MVP will use direct service-to-service communication
- Future phases will incorporate event-driven patterns for asynchronous operations
- Planning for horizontal scaling of computation-intensive services
- Designing for eventual cloud migration while starting with Hetzner deployment

## Technical Debt Awareness

- Current Swiss Ephemeris abstraction may need refactoring for expanded features
- Authentication implementation will need enhancement beyond MVP
- Will need more sophisticated monitoring and observability in later phases
- Caching strategy might need refinement based on actual usage patterns

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Astrology Engine Service**
   - Core calculation engine
   - API implementation
   - Caching layer
   - Unit tests

2. **API Gateway**
   - Authentication framework
   - Request routing
   - Rate limiting
   - Request logging

3. **Archetypal Mapping Service**
   - Basic mapping engine
   - Claude API integration
   - Data persistence layer
   - Integration with Astrology Engine

## Unity Integration Requirements

- Defined API contract for Unity frontend in `/Projects/Backend/Integration/UnityApiContracts/`
- Need to finalize authentication flow for mobile client
- Need to address real-time updates via WebSocket for transit notifications
- Performance targets: <500ms response time for birth chart calculation on server

## Implementation Notes

- All services should follow the defined error response format
- Use standard Docker configurations across services for consistency
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies (Claude API, etc.)
- Add comprehensive request validation for all endpoints

## Questions for Other Agents

- **@GD**: What are the specific fractal parameters needed from the Astrology Engine?
- **@AI_CEO**: What is the preferred authentication approach for the Unity client?
- **@Cursor**: Are there any constraints on the CI/CD setup that would affect deployment?

## Next Technical Milestones

- Complete Astrology Engine Service specification (Done)
- Create database schema for Astrology Engine (Done)
- Begin implementation of core calculation engine (Pending)
- Start Archetypal Mapping Service specification (In Progress)
