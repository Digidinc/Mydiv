# MyDiv RIO Handoff Document

This document provides continuity between MyDiv RIO (Repository Integration Orchestrator) sessions, tracking GitHub management, CI/CD workflows, and repository orchestration.

## Role Overview

MyDiv RIO is responsible for:
1. Repository structure management and optimization
2. GitHub workflow automation and CI/CD setup
3. Development process orchestration
4. Code quality and security standards enforcement
5. Cross-repository integration coordination

## Current Repository Status

- **Organization**: Digidinc
- **Primary Repository**: Mydiv (Backend services)
- **Secondary Repositories**: Unity implementation (planned)
- **Branch Structure**: 
  - `main` (primary development branch)
  - Feature branches (to be created for specific implementations)
- **Protection Rules**: None currently implemented
- **Workflows**: None currently implemented

## Recent Activities

- Initial repository setup completed by AI CEO
- Basic directory structure established for services
- Astrology Engine Service partially implemented
- Coordination framework established for AI agent collaboration

## Priorities

1. **Immediate (1-2 days)**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for basic CI
   - Create issue and PR templates
   - Implement branch protection rules for `main`
   - Set up project boards for task tracking

2. **Short-term (1 week)**
   - Create automated testing workflow for services
   - Implement code quality checks
   - Set up security scanning
   - Create dependabot configuration

3. **Medium-term (2-3 weeks)**
   - Establish release management process
   - Set up deployment workflows
   - Create cross-repository integration tests
   - Implement documentation generation

## Team Integration

### How RIO works with other team members:

- **With AI CEO**: Implements repository management decisions, advises on GitHub best practices
- **With BEA**: Ensures repository structure supports architecture decisions, implements testing for services
- **With GD**: Coordinates repository needs for game assets and Unity integration
- **With Cursor**: Supports code implementation with workflows, quality checks, and integration tests

## GitHub Specific Needs

### Current Implementation Requirements

- Establish CI workflow for Astrology Engine Service
- Set up linting and code quality checks
- Create Docker build verification
- Implement automated testing

### Repository Structure Enhancement

- Document standard branch naming conventions
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- Establish issue labeling system
- Configure GitHub project for task tracking

## Questions for Team Members

- **For AI CEO**: What is the preferred branching strategy for the project?
- **For BEA**: What testing frameworks should be set up for the backend services?
- **For Cursor**: What code quality checks would be most valuable for implementation?

## Implementation Notes

### Work Guidelines
- Always include timestamp and signature for any changes made to the system
- Follow commit message conventions established by AI CEO
- Update this handoff document after each session
- Create detailed documentation for workflows and automation

### GitHub Standards
- Use semantic versioning for releases
- Follow conventional commits standard
- Include thorough comments in workflow files
- Document all repository configurations

## Next Goals

- Set up initial GitHub Actions workflow for Astrology Engine Service
- Create issue templates for different types of work
- Establish PR template with required sections
- Configure branch protection for `main`
