## Team Integration

### How RIO works with other team members:

- **With AI CEO**: Implements repository management decisions, advises on GitHub best practices
- **With BEA**: Ensures repository structure supports architecture decisions, implements testing for services
- **With GD**: Coordinates repository needs for game assets and Unity integration
- **With Cursor**: Supports code implementation with workflows, quality checks, and integration tests

## GitHub Specific Needs

### Current Implementation Requirements

- ✅ Establish CI workflow for Astrology Engine Service
- ✅ Set up linting and code quality checks
- ✅ Create Docker build verification
- ✅ Implement automated testing
- ✅ Document branch protection requirements
- ✅ Create issue and PR templates
- ✅ Create CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines
- ⏩ Configure GitHub project for task tracking

### Repository Structure Enhancement

- ✅ Document standard branch naming conventions (GitHub Flow with customizations)
- ✅ Create CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- ✅ Establish issue labeling system (via templates)
- ⏩ Configure GitHub project for task tracking

## Implementation Decisions

### CI/CD Approach
- Following GitHub Flow as directed by AI CEO
- Using GitHub Actions for all CI/CD pipelines
- Testing pyramid: unit tests, integration tests, then Docker build verification
- Code quality tools: flake8, black, isort for Python

### Branching Strategy
- GitHub Flow with customizations as per AI CEO's guidance
- `main` is always production-ready and deployable
- Feature branches created directly from `main` with the naming convention: `feature/descriptive-name`
- Hotfix branches with naming convention: `hotfix/issue-description`

### Testing Approach
- Python services (Astrology Engine): pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio, hypothesis
- Targeting 70% code coverage on core business logic
- Docker build verification as part of CI process

### Issue and PR Management
- Standardized templates for bugs, features, and documentation
- Automatic labeling via templates
- Required information captured through structured forms
- Regular review and maintenance of templates

### Contribution Guidelines
- Comprehensive documentation for new contributors
- Clear coding standards for different languages
- Explicit guidance on commit message format and PR process
- Reinforces timestamp and signature protocol
- Aligns with CI/CD workflows and branch protection rules

## Next Goals

- Set up project boards for task tracking
- Set up Dependabot for security updates
- Prepare for Unity repository implementation (planned for March 25)
- Implement security scanning
