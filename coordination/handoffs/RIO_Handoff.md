# MyDiv RIO Handoff Document

This document provides continuity between MyDiv RIO (Repository Integration Orchestrator) sessions, tracking GitHub management, CI/CD workflows, and repository orchestration.

## Role Overview

MyDiv RIO is responsible for:
1. Repository structure management and optimization
2. GitHub workflow automation and CI/CD setup
3. Development process orchestration
4. Code quality and security standards enforcement
5. Cross-repository integration coordination

## Current Repository Status

- **Organization**: Digidinc
- **Primary Repository**: Mydiv (Backend services)
- **Secondary Repositories**: Unity implementation (planned for March 25)
- **Branch Structure**: 
  - `main` (primary development branch)
  - Feature branches with naming convention: `feature/descriptive-name`
  - Hotfix branches with naming convention: `hotfix/issue-description`
- **Protection Rules**: None currently implemented (next priority)
- **Workflows**: 
  - GitHub Actions CI for Astrology Engine Service ✅

## Recent Activities

- Initial repository setup completed by AI CEO
- Basic directory structure established for services
- Astrology Engine Service partially implemented
- Coordination framework established for AI agent collaboration
- GitHub Actions workflow implemented for Astrology Engine Service ✅
- Created documentation for CI workflow ✅

## Priorities

1. **Immediate (1-2 days)**
   - ✅ Set up GitHub Actions workflow for basic CI
   - ⏩ Implement branch protection rules for `main` (Next priority)
   - Create issue and PR templates
   - Create CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines
   - Set up project boards for task tracking

2. **Short-term (1 week)**
   - ✅ Create automated testing workflow for services
   - ✅ Implement code quality checks
   - Set up security scanning
   - Create dependabot configuration

3. **Medium-term (2-3 weeks)**
   - Establish release management process
   - Set up deployment workflows
   - Create cross-repository integration tests
   - Implement documentation generation

## Team Integration

### How RIO works with other team members:

- **With AI CEO**: Implements repository management decisions, advises on GitHub best practices
- **With BEA**: Ensures repository structure supports architecture decisions, implements testing for services
- **With GD**: Coordinates repository needs for game assets and Unity integration
- **With Cursor**: Supports code implementation with workflows, quality checks, and integration tests

## GitHub Specific Needs

### Current Implementation Requirements

- ✅ Establish CI workflow for Astrology Engine Service
- ✅ Set up linting and code quality checks
- ✅ Create Docker build verification
- ✅ Implement automated testing
- ⏩ Implement branch protection for `main`

### Repository Structure Enhancement

- Document standard branch naming conventions (GitHub Flow with customizations)
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- Establish issue labeling system
- Configure GitHub project for task tracking

## Implementation Decisions

### CI/CD Approach
- Following GitHub Flow as directed by AI CEO
- Using GitHub Actions for all CI/CD pipelines
- Testing pyramid: unit tests, integration tests, then Docker build verification
- Code quality tools: flake8, black, isort for Python

### Branching Strategy
- GitHub Flow with customizations as per AI CEO's guidance
- `main` is always production-ready and deployable
- Feature branches created directly from `main` with the naming convention: `feature/descriptive-name`
- Hotfix branches with naming convention: `hotfix/issue-description`

### Testing Approach
- Python services (Astrology Engine): pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio, hypothesis
- Targeting 70% code coverage on core business logic
- Docker build verification as part of CI process

## Next Goals

- Implement branch protection for `main` branch
- Create issue templates for bugs, features, and documentation
- Establish PR template with required sections
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines
- Set up Dependabot for security updates

## Documentation

- Created `/coordination/github/CIWorkflow.md` for CI workflow documentation
- Planning to create similar documents for:
  - Branch protection rules
  - Issue templates
  - PR templates
  - Contributing guidelines
