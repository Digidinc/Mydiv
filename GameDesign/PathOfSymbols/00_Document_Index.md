# Path of Symbols Documentation Index

## Overview

This index provides a centralized navigation system for all Path of Symbols design documentation. Each document is linked and briefly described to help team members quickly find the information they need.

## Core Design Documents

   - Visual representations, meanings, and interaction patterns
   - Symbol combination principles and effects

2. [**Path of Symbols Decision Tree**](Path_of_Symbols_Decision_Tree.md) and [Part 2](Path_of_Symbols_Decision_Tree_Part2.md)
   - Complete journey structure with all possible paths
   - Entry point determination based on archetypal profiles
   - Eight distinct ending states with unique insights
   - Transition effects and symbolic representations

3. [**Path of Symbols Interaction Mechanics**](Path_of_Symbols_Interaction_Mechanics.md)
   - User interaction patterns and gesture systems
   - Visual, audio, and haptic feedback specifications
   - Accessibility considerations and alternative interactions
   - Technical implementation guidelines

4. [**Fractal Response System**](Fractal_Response_System_Part1.md) and [Part 2](Fractal_Response_System_Part2.md)
   - Mathematical models for fractal generation
   - Parameter mapping from user choices and profile
   - Color introduction strategy and animation behaviors
   - Technical implementation specifications

5. [**Archetypal Integration Guidelines**](Archetypal_Integration_Guidelines_Part1.md), [Part 2](Archetypal_Integration_Guidelines_Part2.md), and [Part 3](Archetypal_Integration_Guidelines_Part3.md)
   - Profile data structure and retrieval mechanisms
   - Adaptation systems for personalization
   - Integration with astrological and journal systems
   - Implementation approach and algorithms

## Supporting Documents

1. [**Alignment Analysis and Next Steps**](Alignment_Analysis_and_Next_Steps.md)
   - Analysis of alignment with broader project
   - Identified areas for further integration
   - Next steps with priorities and timelines

2. [**Letter to Essi (Unity Developer)**](Letter_to_Essi_Unity_Developer.md)

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Game Designers
Start with the Symbol Library and Decision Tree documents to understand the core symbolic system and journey structure. Then review the Interaction Mechanics and Fractal Response System to understand the user experience design.

### For Unity Developers
Begin with the Letter to Essi document for implementation priorities, then dive into the Fractal Response System and Interaction Mechanics for technical specifications. Reference the Symbol Library and Decision Tree as needed for content details.

### For Backend Developers
Focus on the Archetypal Integration Guidelines to understand how the Path of Symbols integrates with backend services and user profiles.

### For Project Managers
Review the Alignment Analysis and Next Steps document to understand how this feature fits into the broader project context and the upcoming tasks on the roadmap.
