## Archetypal Profile Integration

The user's archetypal profile (derived from their birth chart) influences their journey in three key ways:

### 1. Entry Point Customization
As described in the Entry Point section, the user's dominant archetypal energy determines their initial visualization and context.

### 2. Subtle Path Guidance
If the Path of Symbols detects that a particular choice would be especially growth-promoting for the user's archetypal profile, subtle visual cues will appear:

- **For Fire-dominant profiles** (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius): Subtle flame or light elements appear near growth-promoting choices
- **For Earth-dominant profiles** (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn): Subtle crystal or root elements appear near growth-promoting choices
- **For Air-dominant profiles** (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius): Subtle wind or bird elements appear near growth-promoting choices
- **For Water-dominant profiles** (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces): Subtle water or flow elements appear near growth-promoting choices

These cues are designed to be noticeable but not controllingâ€”users remain free to choose either path.

### 3. Personalized Outcome Interpretation
When a user reaches one of the eight endings, the interpretation and reflection prompts are subtly tailored to their archetypal profile:

- **For Creator archetypes**: Emphasis on how this realization can be expressed or manifested
- **For Seeker archetypes**: Emphasis on how this realization expands their journey
- **For Sage archetypes**: Emphasis on how this realization deepens their understanding
- **For Hero archetypes**: Emphasis on how this realization empowers their actions
- **For Caregiver archetypes**: Emphasis on how this realization nurtures themselves and others
- **For Ruler archetypes**: Emphasis on how this realization brings order and direction

## Fractal Visualization Evolution

The fractal visualization evolves throughout the journey, reflecting the user's choices and archetypal energies.

### Base Visualization

- **Starting State**: Modified Mandelbrot set in black and white
- **Initial Motion**: Gentle pulsing at center
- **Audio Component**: Subtle ambient drone at 432Hz
- **Interaction**: Responsive to touch/click (gentle ripple effect)

### Evolution Principles

1. **Choice Reflection**: Each binary choice shifts the fractal pattern in specific ways:
   - **Expansive choices** (Explorer, Confront, Create, etc.): Pattern expands and becomes more complex
   - **Concentrative choices** (Observer, Accept, Know, etc.): Pattern becomes more detailed and intricate

2. **Color Introduction**: Color enters the visualization at key moments:
   - **First decision**: Subtle primary color based on chosen path
   - **Second decision**: Secondary color creating meaningful combinations
   - **Final decision**: Full color palette reflecting complete journey

3. **Pattern Transformation**: By the final outcome, the fractal has transformed into one of eight distinct patterns, each representing the archetypal state of that ending.

4. **Personalization Elements**: Subtle elements from the user's birth chart (planetary symbols, element affinities) are incorporated into the visualization.

## Implementation Priorities

For the initial MVP implementation, we will prioritize:

1. Complete decision tree structure with all 8 endings
2. Basic visualization evolution for each path
3. Entry point customization based on archetypal profile
4. Core symbol integration at each decision point
5. Simplified outcome interpretations and journal prompts

Future enhancements (post-MVP) will include:
- More sophisticated fractal animations
- Expanded symbol interactions
- Additional subtle path guidance
- Enhanced audio components
- More detailed personalization

## Technical Recommendations

- Implement the decision tree as a data-driven system to facilitate future expansion
- Store symbol associations and meanings in a structured database
- Use shader parameters to evolve fractal visualization based on user choices
- Create a flexible template system for outcome interpretations
- Implement analytics to track which paths users take most frequently

## Next Steps

1. Review this decision tree structure with the team
2. Create detailed visual specifications for each decision point
3. Develop technical design document with Unity implementation guidelines
4. Create prototype of key decision points for testing
5. Test symbolic resonance with representative users
