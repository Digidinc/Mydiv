## Archetypal Profile Integration

### Profile Parameter Mapping

The user's archetypal profile (derived from astrological data) maps to fractal parameters:

1. **Elemental Affinity Mapping**
   - **Fire dominance** (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius):
     - Higher iteration depth in outer regions
     - More dynamic animation behavior
     - Tendency toward expansion and growth
     - Warm color affinity (reds, golds, oranges)
   
   - **Earth dominance** (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn):
     - More structured, geometric patterns
     - Higher stability in animation
     - Tendency toward detail and precision
     - Natural color affinity (greens, browns, ambers)
   
   - **Air dominance** (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius):
     - More connective lines between elements
     - Higher variability in pattern
     - Tendency toward complexity and interconnection
     - Clear color affinity (blues, whites, yellows)
   
   - **Water dominance** (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces):
     - More flowing, boundary-dissolving patterns
     - Wave-like animation behaviors
     - Tendency toward depth and merging
     - Deep color affinity (blues, purples, sea greens)

2. **Planetary Influence Mapping**
   - **Sun position**: Affects central pattern structure
   - **Moon position**: Influences animation rhythm and flow
   - **Ascendant**: Determines initial pattern orientation
   - **Venus/Mars balance**: Affects harmony vs. dynamic tension in pattern
   - **Jupiter position**: Influences expansion rate and potential
   - **Saturn position**: Affects boundary definition and limitation

3. **Aspect Pattern Integration**
   - **Grand Trines**: Creates threefold symmetry elements
   - **Squares/Oppositions**: Introduces creative tension in pattern
   - **Stellium** (planet clusters): Creates dense pattern regions
   - **Yod configurations**: Creates "finger of fate" directional elements

### Subtle Symbolic Elements

Subtle symbolic elements from the user's chart appear within the fractal:

1. **Zodiac Symbols**
   - User's sun sign symbol subtly appears in central region
   - Ascendant symbol influences overall pattern shape
   - Moon sign creates texture or depth effect

2. **Planetary Glyphs**
   - Dominant planetary symbols appear as subtle pattern elements
   - Placement corresponds to astrological house position
   - Size/brightness reflects planetary strength in chart

3. **Aspect Lines**
   - Key aspect relationships create subtle connection lines
   - Harmonious aspects (trines, sextiles) create flowing connections
   - Challenging aspects (squares, oppositions) create dynamic tensions

## Technical Components

### Shader Implementation

1. **Core Shader Parameters**
   - **Fractal Type**: Integer selecting base fractal algorithm
   - **Iteration Depth**: Float controlling computational depth
   - **Center Coordinates**: Vector2 for pan/zoom positioning
   - **Zoom Level**: Float for magnification factor
   - **Color Parameters**: Various parameters controlling color mapping
   - **Time Factor**: Float for animation speed control
   - **Archetypal Parameters**: Vector4 containing profile coefficients

2. **Shader Variants**
   - High quality variant for capable devices

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Progressive rendering for complex scenes
   - Dynamic iteration depth based on performance monitoring
   - Frame rate targeting with quality adjustment
   - Caching of stable states to reduce computation

### Audio-Visual Synchronization

The fractal visualization synchronizes with audio components:

1. **Base Frequency Alignment**
   - Visual pulse rate aligned with 432Hz audio foundation
   - Harmonic relationships between audio and visual rhythms
   - Common mathematical basis for both domains

2. **Cross-Domain Mapping**
   - Audio frequency spectrum maps to visual color spectrum
   - Sound amplitude influences pattern size and intensity
   - Audio rhythmic elements drive animation timing
   - Harmonic relationships appear in both domains simultaneously

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Audio analysis via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
   - Extraction of key frequency bands and rhythmic elements
   - Parameter mapping from audio to visual domain
   - Shared mathematical models between audio and visual generators

## User Interaction Effects

### Touch Response Mapping

User interactions with the fractal create meaningful responses:

1. **Direct Touch Effects**
   - Touch creates ripple effect from contact point
   - Holding creates growing resonance pattern
   - Multiple touches create interference patterns
   - Touch position influences which elements respond

2. **Gesture Effects**
   - Pinch/zoom adjusts view depth and detail level
   - Rotation gesture influences pattern orientation
   - Swipe creates directional energy flow
   - Drawing specific shapes can activate related patterns

3. **Intentional Interaction**
   - System detects rhythmic vs. random interaction
   - Consistent patterns of interaction amplify response
   - Mindful, slower interactions create deeper effects
   - System encourages exploration through varied responses

### Device Motion Integration

On devices with motion sensors:

1. **Orientation Response**
   - Subtle parallax effect with device orientation
   - Reveals hidden depth within fractal structure
   - Different layers respond at different rates
   - Creates sense of three-dimensional space

2. **Movement Response**
   - Gentle device movement creates fluid motion in pattern
   - Abrupt movement creates more energetic response
   - System distinguishes intentional vs. incidental motion
   - Calibration to user's typical movement patterns
