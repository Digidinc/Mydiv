# Path of Symbols Design Documentation

This directory contains the comprehensive design documentation for the Path of Symbols mini-game, a core feature of the MyDivinations MVP. The Path of Symbols provides users with an interactive symbolic journey that responds to their choices, helping them discover personal archetypal patterns.

## Directory Structure

- **Symbol_Library_Documentation.md**: Comprehensive catalog of all symbols used in the game
- **Path_of_Symbols_Decision_Tree.md**: Complete decision tree structure with all possible paths
- **Path_of_Symbols_Interaction_Mechanics.md**: Detailed interaction patterns and user experience design
- **Fractal_Response_System.md**: Specifications for the fractal visualization system
- **Archetypal_Integration_Guidelines.md**: Guidelines for integrating with user's archetypal profile

## Design Philosophy

These documents follow the MyDivinations design principles:

1. **Symbolism First, Mechanics Second**: All design elements begin with archetypal meaning before defining mechanics
2. **The Power of Binary Choice**: Simple binary choices create powerful archetypal resonance
3. **Color as Consciousness Marker**: Intentional use of color to signal consciousness frequency
4. **Liminal Space Design**: Focusing on the transformative spaces between choices

All designs maintain alignment with the minimalist black and white aesthetic with intentional color introduction at key moments.

## Implementation Status

These documents represent the initial design phase. Next steps include:

1. Team review and feedback
2. Visual development of key elements
3. Technical implementation planning
4. Integration with astrological and journal systems
