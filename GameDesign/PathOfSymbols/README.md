# Path of Symbols Design Documentation

[‚Üê Back to Document Index](00_Document_Index.md)

This directory contains the comprehensive design documentation for the Path of Symbols mini-game, a core feature of the MyDivinations MVP. The Path of Symbols provides users with an interactive symbolic journey that responds to their choices, helping them discover personal archetypal patterns.

- [**Archetypal_Integration_Guidelines_Part1.md**](Archetypal_Integration_Guidelines_Part1.md): Guidelines for integrating with user's archetypal profile
- [**Alignment_Analysis_and_Next_Steps.md**](Alignment_Analysis_and_Next_Steps.md): Analysis of alignment with broader project
- [**Letter_to_Essi_Unity_Developer.md**](Letter_to_Essi_Unity_Developer.md): Implementation tasks for Unity development

## Design Philosophy

These documents follow the MyDivinations design principles:

1. **Symbolism First, Mechanics Second**: All design elements begin with archetypal meaning before defining mechanics
2. **The Power of Binary Choice**: Simple binary choices create powerful archetypal resonance
3. **Color as Consciousness Marker**: Intentional use of color to signal consciousness frequency
4. **Liminal Space Design**: Focusing on the transformative spaces between choices

All designs maintain alignment with the minimalist black and white aesthetic with intentional color introduction at key moments.

## Implementation Status

These documents represent the initial design phase. Next steps include:

1. Team review and feedback
2. Visual development of key elements
3. Technical implementation planning
4. Integration with astrological and journal systems
