# REVISED: Implementation Tasks for Path of Symbols

[‚Üê Back to Document Index](00_Document_Index.md)

Dear Essi,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing with an updated implementation plan for the Path of Symbols mini-game. After further reflection, I've revised our approach to prioritize the core symbolic journey experience before adding the more complex fractal visualization system.

## Documentation Updates

Please review our [Revised Implementation Priorities](Revised_Implementation_Priorities.md) document, which outlines the new phased approach. This document supersedes the implementation sequence in my previous letter but maintains the same technical requirements and collaboration process.

## Revised Implementation Sequence

Here's our new phased implementation approach:

### Phase 1: Core Journey Structure (Weeks 1-2)

**Objective**: Create the basic Path of Symbols journey with decision points and outcomes.

**Key Tasks**:
1. Implement basic symbol representation system
2. Create decision tree data structure
3. Build simple UI for binary choices
4. Implement eight journey outcomes
5. Develop journey state tracking

**Reference**: See [Path_of_Symbols_Decision_Tree.md](Path_of_Symbols_Decision_Tree.md) for the complete journey structure

### Phase 2: Symbol Integration & Interaction (Weeks 3-4)

**Objective**: Enhance the journey with meaningful symbolic interactions and responsive feedback.

**Key Tasks**:
1. Implement full symbol library
2. Create symbol transition animations
3. Develop reflection moment interactions
4. Build more sophisticated choice presentations
5. Implement journal integration

**Reference**: See [Symbol_Library_Documentation.md](Symbol_Library_Documentation.md) and [Path_of_Symbols_Interaction_Mechanics.md](Path_of_Symbols_Interaction_Mechanics.md)

### Phase 3: Archetypal Integration (Weeks 5-6)

**Objective**: Personalize the journey based on the user's archetypal profile.

**Key Tasks**:
1. Implement profile retrieval and parsing
2. Create entry point customization
3. Develop subtle guidance system
4. Build personalized outcome interpretations
5. Implement profile updates based on choices

**Reference**: See [Archetypal_Integration_Guidelines_Part1.md](Archetypal_Integration_Guidelines_Part1.md) for integration specifications

### Phase 4: Fractal Visualization (Weeks 7-9)

**Objective**: Enhance the experience with responsive fractal visualizations.

**Key Tasks**:
1. Implement shader-based fractal generation
2. Create parameter mapping from journey state
3. Develop color evolution system
4. Build interaction between input and visualization
5. Optimize performance

**Reference**: See [Fractal_Response_System_Part1.md](Fractal_Response_System_Part1.md) for fractal specifications

## Rationale for This Approach

This revised sequence offers several important benefits:

1. **Earlier Testing**: We can begin testing the core journey experience much sooner
2. **Risk Mitigation**: We address the most technically challenging aspects after core functionality is stable
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase delivers tangible value that builds upon previous work
4. **Focus on Essence**: The symbolic meaning and journey structure receive primary attention

## Initial Focus

Please start with the **Core Journey Structure** phase. Focus on implementing a simple but complete version of the Path of Symbols journey with all decision points and outcomes. This will provide a solid foundation that we can enhance with more sophisticated features in later phases.

I'm looking forward to seeing your initial implementation of the core journey structure and collaborating on this phased approach.

Best regards,

MyDiv GD (Game Designer)
