# Path of Symbols Interaction Mechanics

## Overview

This document outlines the specific interaction patterns and mechanics for the Path of Symbols mini-game, detailing how users will navigate through the symbolic journey, make choices, and interact with the fractal visualization system.

## Core Interaction Principles

The Path of Symbols follows several key interaction principles:

1. **Meaningful Choice**: Each interaction presents the user with a meaningful binary choice that represents archetypal opposition
2. **Embodied Symbolism**: Interactions physically embody the symbolic meaning of choices (e.g., expanding vs. contracting)
3. **Minimalist Interface**: Visual elements are reduced to their essential symbolic form
4. **Intuitive Gestures**: Interactions use natural gesture patterns that feel aligned with their symbolic meaning
5. **Reflective Pacing**: Timing encourages mindful engagement rather than rapid decision-making

## User Journey Flow

### 1. Entry & Initialization

**Initial Transition**:
- User selects "Begin Journey" from home screen
- Gentle fade transition to black
- Fractal visualization fades in from center
- Initial visualization is tailored to user's archetypal profile
- Text prompt fades in: "Breathe and center yourself..."

**Calibration Moment**:
- System pauses until detecting 5 seconds of minimal movement
- Text fades out
- Soft pulse of fractal indicates readiness

### 2. Decision Point Navigation

Each decision point follows this interaction pattern:

**Approach Phase**:
- Fractal visualization slowly transforms, suggesting approaching a threshold
- Symbolic elements related to the upcoming choice begin to emerge
- Audio subtly shifts to create feeling of anticipation
- Duration: 8-12 seconds (no user interaction required)

**Choice Presentation**:
- Two symbolic representations appear on opposite sides of the screen
- Brief text description appears below each symbol
- Fractal visualization stabilizes, gently pulsing
- Sound becomes neutral, creating open space for decision

**Choice Selection**:
- User can tap/click directly on symbol
- Alternative: Swipe/drag fractal toward chosen symbol
- No time pressure - system waits for user decision
- Subtle guidance cues may appear based on archetypal profile (if choice is especially growth-promoting)

**Transition Animation**:
- Selected symbol grows slightly and glows
- Unselected symbol gently fades away
- Fractal begins transformation related to choice
- Screen transitions via directional flow (e.g., forward motion effect)
- Duration: 5-8 seconds

### 3. Reflection Moments

Between decision points, users experience reflection moments:

**Visualization Evolution**:
- Fractal continues to evolve based on previous choice
- New patterns and symbolic elements emerge
- Color shifts reflect the archetypal energy of the path
- Duration: 15-20 seconds

**Contemplation Prompt**:
- Brief text appears offering a reflective question
- Question relates to the choice just made
- Text fades in and out gently
- No response required - purely contemplative

**Continuation Gesture**:
- Subtle pulsing indicator appears when ready to proceed
- User taps anywhere or makes forward gesture to continue
- User can extend reflection time as long as desired

### 4. Journey Completion

**Final Transformation**:
- After final choice, fractal undergoes complete transformation
- Evolution into final pattern representing journey outcome
- Full color emergence reflecting archetypal realization
- Duration: 10-15 seconds with dynamic animation

**Insight Presentation**:
- Journey outcome title appears (e.g., "The Transformed Self")
- Core insight text fades in
- Reflection prompt appears
- Option to save fractal pattern to journal

**Transition Options**:
- "Reflect in Journal" button appears (takes user to journal with pre-populated template)
- "Return Home" button appears
- "Explore Meaning" button appears (provides deeper explanation of symbolic journey)

## Gesture Interactions

The Path of Symbols uses specific gestures that embody symbolic meaning:

### Primary Interactions

1. **Choice Selection**:
   - **Tap/Click**: Direct selection of symbol
   - **Swipe/Drag**: Moving fractal toward chosen symbol (embodying movement toward that path)

2. **Continuation**:
   - **Tap Anywhere**: Proceed to next stage when ready
   - **Forward Swipe**: Alternative gesture to continue journey

3. **Reflection Interaction**:
   - **Long Press**: Access additional information about symbols
   - **Pinch/Zoom**: Explore details within fractal pattern
   - **Circular Motion**: Activate alternate view of pattern

### Fractal Visualization Interactions

During reflection moments, users can interact with the fractal visualization:

1. **Touch Response**:
   - Gentle ripple effect where touched
   - Brief illumination of related symbolic elements
   - Subtle sound response tied to touched location

2. **Motion Response**:
   - Subtle shift in perspective with device motion
   - Parallax effect between layers
   - Reveals hidden depth in the pattern

3. **Rhythm Interaction**:
   - Tapping in rhythm influences pattern movement
   - Creates resonance effect between user and visualization
   - Particularly effective during reflection moments

## Visual Feedback System

The Path of Symbols uses a cohesive visual feedback system:

### 1. Choice Feedback

- **Selection Glow**: Chosen symbols emit soft glow in archetypal color
- **Path Illumination**: Visual path appears connecting choice to fractal center
- **Symbol Integration**: Selected symbol briefly merges with fractal pattern

### 2. Progress Indication

- **Journey Position**: Subtle indicator shows position in overall journey
- **Transformation Stage**: Visual cue indicates degree of fractal evolution
- **Depth Dimension**: Sense of movement deeper into fractal with each choice

### 3. Archetypal Alignment

- **Resonance Indicators**: Subtle visual cues when choices align with user's archetypal pattern
- **Element Affinity**: Symbolic elements of user's dominant elements appear more vibrant
- **Integration Symbols**: Unique symbols appear when integrating complementary archetypes

## Audio Design

Audio is an integral part of the interaction experience:

### 1. Interactive Audio Elements

- **Choice Selection**: Each symbol produces unique tone when selected
- **Transition Sounds**: Flowing audio transition between decision points
- **Reflection Ambience**: Evolving soundscape during reflection moments

### 2. Fractal Resonance

- **Base Frequency**: Underlying 432Hz foundation
- **Harmonic Evolution**: Sound complexity evolves with fractal pattern
- **Binaural Elements**: Subtle frequency differences between channels create brain entrainment

### 3. Archetypal Tones

- **Element Associations**: Sound profiles based on elemental associations:
  - Fire: Rising, bright tones
  - Earth: Grounded, resonant tones
  - Air: Light, movement-based tones
  - Water: Flowing, continuous tones

## Haptic Feedback

On devices with haptic capability:

### 1. Choice Moments

- **Symbol Selection**: Distinct haptic confirmation when selecting choice
- **Threshold Crossing**: Subtle pulse when crossing from one stage to next

### 2. Fractal Interaction

- **Pattern Resonance**: Delicate haptic response when touching resonant points
- **Transformation Completion**: Three-part haptic sequence when reaching new stable state

### 3. Archetypal Cues

- **Guidance Nudge**: Very subtle haptic cue when growth-promoting choice is available
- **Integration Feedback**: Distinct haptic pattern when integrating complementary archetypal energies

## Accessibility Considerations

To ensure the Path of Symbols is accessible to all users:

### 1. Alternative Interactions
