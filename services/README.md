## Development Guidelines

### Service Structure

Each service should follow this structure:

```
/service-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                 # Source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/             # API endpoints
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/            # Core business logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/          # Data models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # Business services
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/           # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/               # Test suite
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ unit/            # Unit tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ integration/     # Integration tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ e2e/             # End-to-end tests
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                # Service-specific documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile           # Container definition
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml   # Local development setup
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example         # Example environment variables
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Service-specific instructions
```

### Technology Selection

- **Python Services**: FastAPI or Flask based on performance needs
- **Node.js Services**: Express with TypeScript
- **Database Access**: Repository pattern with ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based through API Gateway
- **Testing**: pytest for Python, Jest for Node.js
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for all APIs
- **Caching**: Redis for high-performance caching

### Development Workflow

1. Start from the service specification in `/docs/specifications/`
2. Create the service structure following the guidelines
3. Implement core functionality with tests
4. Document APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger
5. Create Docker configurations
6. Submit PR with reference to implementation checklist

### Communication Patterns

- All services should implement the patterns defined in `/docs/architecture/service-communication-patterns.md`
- Error responses should follow the standardized format
- Authentication should be handled through the API Gateway
- Services should use the circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
- Redis should be used for caching where appropriate

## Service Launch Checklist

Before a service is considered ready for deployment, ensure:

- [ ] All specified functionality implemented
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Integration tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Documentation completed
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Docker configuration tested
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured
- [ ] Health checks implemented
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented

## Deployment

Services are deployed using Docker containers orchestrated through Docker Compose:

1. Each service has its own container
2. Shared resources (Redis, etc.) are in separate containers
3. API Gateway handles routing and authentication
4. Monitoring through Prometheus/Grafana
5. Logging through structured JSON logs

## Current Focus

- âœ… Initial Astrology Engine Service setup complete
- ðŸ”„ Implementing Swiss Ephemeris integration
- ðŸ”„ Developing birth chart calculation endpoints
- ðŸ”„ Setting up service monitoring and logging
- ðŸ”„ Implementing caching strategies
